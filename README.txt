whereTHEDUCKami Application:
WhereTheDuckAMI is an application that utilizes the maps made available by Western to allow users to search and explore its interior spaces. The application allows users to search for rooms in buildings, locate points of interest in a building, browse through the maps provided, and create and save their own personal points of interest. Navigating through university campuses can prove to be quite daunting due to frequent building renovations and constantly evolving school grounds. This can be challenging for both new and returning students and faculty alike, as getting lost is inevitable. Although advanced mapping applications have greatly improved outdoor navigation, in times of dire need, like when a student is unable to locate their exam room or a faculty member struggles to find a colleague's office, relying on Google maps may not be enough. Therefore, our software application aims to bridge this gap, and provide users with interior navigation abilities that most mapping services lack. For example a search function for specific points of interest (POI’s) within multi-levelled buildings. Our application utilize's Western's official building floor plans to offer a comprehensive navigation system that enables all university-goers to effortlessly maneuver through complex campus buildings.
